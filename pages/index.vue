I spent two solid days one fine Tokyo autumn with the Sea You Soon team at the 2017 Global Goals Jam, brainstorming and prototyping ways to get city-oriented Tokyoites and their children to engage with the natural water resources around them. "Global Goals Jam? What the heck is that!?" I hear you ask. Well, the Global Goals Jam (GGJ) is an annual event run simultaneously in 20? cities around the world, in which participants use UX design principles to address one of 23? sustainability goals put together by the United Nations Development Program. I was lucky enough to be selected as a facilitator by a colleague of mine, urbanist Mariko Sugita.`,

It turns out that going to a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament might not always be as cheery as it sounds; no matter how friendly the competition, losing out 0-2 in tournament sucks. Like, /really/ sucks. It's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had, and when I found myself in that spot, wanting to run and hide while I was among friends, all I could think was, "I have to fix this." This is a story about searching for redemption, for all of us down there, bravely grinding away in the lower half of the bracket. This is a story of positivity, and of gradual growth, and of being proud of what you achieved, even if you lost 0-2. This is one for the underdogs.`,
