        This is a project that was born out of frustration and self-disgust. Born out of feeling dejected, and worthless, and never wanting to come back. It turns out that going to a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament isn't always as cheery as it sounds. No matter how friendly the competition, losing out 0-2 in a tournament sucks. Like, really sucks. Even if you don't consider yourself a competitive player, it's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had. When I found myself in that position, wanting to run and hide even while I was among friends, all I could...

        I've seen a lot of discussion around top-down UX: earning a seat at the table and convincing higher-ups that UX is worth pursuing companywide. This is very, very important. However, it can also lead to what I've seen at most "User Experience Designer" jobs I've had: UX being brought in as a feel-good buzzword, interaction design getting rebranded as being "user centered," and no real methodological changes. That's not to mention the enormous time and effort it can take to gain enough trust to convince leaders, especially in a foreign culture, especially as an outsider. That's where a bottom-up...

        From abandoned to awesome! Along with the unstoppable Matt Tomasulo, I helped push the envelope of creative potential for underused spaces within my hometown of Raleigh, NC. Our goal was to get people thinking about how abandoned spaces could be put to use by staging a guerrilla urbanist intervention around an unused lot downtown. We started out thinking broad, concocting a plan to design interventions for various underutilized spaces around Raleigh. We would create physical and digital campaigns to build buzz, with the end goal of attracting funding to make our concepts into reality. Our first...

        Inspired by challenges I faced while teaching myself Japanese, I designed a concept tablet app to help self-teachers learn languages. Over the span of eight weeks, I conducted interviews, researched existing tools, mapped the service, iterated on screens, and shot and animated a demo video. My first step was to define the needs of my users, so I reached out to language learners as well as language teachers for some interviews. It became clear that for self-teachers, most learning took place in the gaps between their day-to-day responsibilities, and that their learning styles and levels of dedication...

Understanding the scope of your options, along with the potential feelings that can be created through those options, is crucial to intentionally design the experience of playing your game. Good? Good. Let's begin with a few basic definitions. FPS stands for First-Person Shooter. HUD is short for Heads-Up Display,or basically the non-game elements that are shown on the player's screen at all times. That usually means things like health, a map, a player's teammates, etc. A damage indicator is what appears on the player's HUD when they take damage from an attack in a game.

Over the span of eight weeks, I conducted interviews, researched existing tools, mapped the service, iterated on screens, and shot and animated a demo video. My first step was to define the needs of my users, so I reached out to language learners as well as language teachers for some interviews. It became clear that for self-teachers, most learning took place in the gaps between their day-to-day responsibilities, and that their learning styles and levels of dedication varied dramatically. Next, I did some foundational research into the different kinds of tools available to language learners. Based on my interview results and other information I dug up through my research, I created a map to figure out how the tool I was designing would fit within the ecosystem."}],postOrder:["positivity","mentor","monitor","beach","verbose","hud"]}],error:null,state:{userLanguage:"en-us",page:"home"},serverRendered:!0}</script><script src="/_nuxt/manifest.ca9e8f9fe85b7598ef8c.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/layouts/default.b60561fdc3839373422f.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/pages/index.63a4f6817d320d01fee6.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/vendor.7fc04129592c3e03d2c8.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/app.4d39b89825803582156c.js" defer></script>
