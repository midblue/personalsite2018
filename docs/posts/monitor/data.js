  description: `This is a quick post about a fun project I did while working in Tokyo. It's got a lot of moving parts meshing together to make a nice, self-contained utility. So what is it? The idea was to make a tool that would track negative tweet activity about the company's games so that we can detect server or service issues before they're reflected in other metrics. As the lead engineer, I got to flex my full-stack muscles on this project. I was also in charge of designing the tool's visuals and interactions. The client for this Twitter Monitor app uses Vue to generate everything, even as far down as the internals of the SVG graphs! That's right, I got to learn how to hand-code SVGs for this one. The frontend is responsive, adapting to phones, desktop, and tv screens â€“ the CS team keeps a giant monitor projecting this app 24/7. The graphs can be dragged back in time, and the live previews run in an infinite ticker.`
