  description: `Recently, a colleague of mine named Mariko Sugita needed to hire a designer for a website she was creating. She’s an urbanist, and not particularly involved in the digital design field, so she asked the closest designer who happened to be on hand (me), “what kind of designers should I be looking for?” I thought for a moment and realized that I had several possible answers, none of which quite summed up the full scope of roles that are present in our field today and what each designer’s assumed title really says about their abilities. That started me thinking about what exactly the spectrum of digital design roles really looks like here in Common Era 2018. I started sketching out my ideas. When Mariko saw my notes for this article, she said, “yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to know beforehand!” I hope that this overview can be just as useful for you, too. Let’s begin!`
