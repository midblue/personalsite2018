  description: `From abandoned to awesome! Along with the unstoppable Matt Tomasulo, I helped push the envelope of creative potential for underused spaces within my hometown of Raleigh, NC. Our goal was to get people thinking about how abandoned spaces could be put to use by staging a guerrilla urbanist intervention around an unused lot downtown. We started out thinking broad, concocting a plan to design interventions for various underutilized spaces around Raleigh. We would create physical and digital campaigns to build buzz, with the end goal of attracting funding to make our concepts into reality. Our first target had been chosen, and not having any clue what kind of response we would get from the public or the owners of the property, we got to work. Some panoramic photos, a few hours in Photoshop, and a few trips to a sign store later, we were ready to put the plan in motion.`,
