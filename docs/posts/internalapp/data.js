  description: `Research is a broad topic. When I joined a Tokyo game company's research division in 2017, my teammates only did technical research â€” patents, hardware tests, and peer reviewed publications. Then there was me: the only person at the entire 2000+ employee company who had "UX" in their job title. This is the story of a project I led which helped bring UX research to the table. One of my main goals at the company was to introduce user-centered thinking and creation methods to the employees, many of whom had never heard of UX before. It was going to be an uphill struggle.`
