Born out of feeling dejected, and worthless, and never wanting to come back. It turns out that going to a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament isn't always as cheery as it sounds. No matter how friendly the competition, losing out 0-2 in a tournament sucks. Like, really sucks. Even if you don't consider yourself a competitive player, it's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had. When I found myself in that position, wanting to run and hide even while I was among friends, all I could think was, &#34;I have to do something about this.&#34; This is about searching for redemption for all of us down there, bravely grinding away in the loser's side of the bracket. This is a story of positivity, and of gradual growth, and of being proud of what you achieved, even if you lost 0-2.

It's the only form of user interview I've ever done where I couldn't look my interviewee in the eye; we were always both too focused on the game onscreen.<p class="centered-in-column" data-v-41cfae36>This was quite a challenge. On the one hand, I have to do all of the standard interview things like keep the conversation flowing in a direction that gives me useable insights into what I want to know. On the other hand, I have to actively play the game and try to put up a good challenge so they'd feel engaged and want to keep playing. All the while, I have to memorize their answers long enough to scramble for my notepad after the interview and scribble down what I had just heard as reliably as possible. <strong>It was the most engaged and human set of interviews I've ever done.</strong></p><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><div class="post-image" style="max-height:600px" data-v-55203c72 data-v-41cfae36><img src="/posts/positivity/5.jpg" alt="My standard interview setup." data-v-55203c72><div class="caption" style="max-width:nullpx" data-v-55203c72>

Here, though, we were communicating through the game on a competitive and fun level, with the push and pull of the game providing a natural flow of tension and resolution to the conversation. It felt like a scene from a movie, where the main characters duel while trading quips. It made for a fantastically engaging set of interviews, and a relaxed and open set of interviewees.<p class="centered-in-column" data-v-41cfae36>My interview topics focused on a few key points of interest:</p><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><div class="centered-in-column" data-v-41cfae36><ul data-v-41cfae36><li data-v-41cfae36><strong>In the Moment:</strong> What factors shape a player's feelings and actions after a loss?
