  description: `This is a project that was born out of frustration and self-disgust. Born out of feeling dejected, and worthless, and never wanting to come back. It turns out that going to a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament isn't always as cheery as it sounds. No matter how friendly the competition, losing out 0-2 in a tournament sucks. Like, really sucks. Even if you don't consider yourself a competitive player, it's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had. When I found myself in that position, wanting to run and hide even while I was among friends, all I could think was, "I have to do something about this." This is about searching for redemption for all of us down there, bravely grinding away in the loser's side of the bracket. This is a story of positivity, and of gradual growth, and of being proud of what you achieved, even if you lost 0-2. This is one for the underdogs.`
