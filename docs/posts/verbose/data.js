  description: `Inspired by challenges I faced while teaching myself Japanese, I designed a concept tablet app to help self-teachers learn languages. Over the span of eight weeks, I conducted interviews, researched existing tools, mapped the service, iterated on screens, and shot and animated a demo video. My first step was to define the needs of my users, so I reached out to language learners as well as language teachers for some interviews. It became clear that for self-teachers, most learning took place in the gaps between their day-to-day responsibilities, and that their learning styles and levels of dedication varied dramatically. Next, I did some foundational research into the different kinds of tools available to language learners. Based on my interview results and other information I dug up through my research, I created a map to figure out how the tool I was designing would fit within the ecosystem.`,
