  description: `I've seen a lot of discussion around top-down UX: earning a seat at the table and convincing higher-ups that UX is worth pursuing companywide. This is very, very important. However, it can also lead to what I've seen at most "User Experience Designer" jobs I've had: UX being brought in as a feel-good buzzword, interaction design getting rebranded as being "user centered," and no real methodological changes. That's not to mention the enormous time and effort it can take to gain enough trust to convince leaders, especially in a foreign culture, especially as an outsider. That's where a bottom-up mentorship approach to gaining UX acceptance can also be crucial in cultures where it's not common: you can help build the foundation of local UX champions that will spark the user centered revolution from the inside.`
