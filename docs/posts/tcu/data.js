  description: `It makes sense, right? Urbanism is the study of places and the people who live in them, so of course it would have a 'sense of place'. The thing is, though, that much of the current discourse — essays, interviews, event reports — tends to exist in a bubble; just the one report about the one city, or the event series only in the one building, and so on and so forth. What about all the other urbanism-related topics in that city? In that country? In that continent? I was lucky enough to lead the design (ux, interaction, and visual) and full-stack development on a new responsive platform that puts urban narratives and practices in context with one another, globally.`,
