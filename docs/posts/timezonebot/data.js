  description: `My closest friends from my school days and I keep in touch regularly through Discord, a Slack-esque chat tool focused around gaming. As we've gotten older, we've begun to spread out all over the world, which that means that many of us live in vastly different time zones. Very often we resort to googling what time it is in Japan, or in Oregon, or in North Carolina. I decided that there had to be a simple way to ease our timezone woes that wouldn't require trips to the browser, or even knowing where a person was currently located. Thus, with the goal of helping our group communicate and understand each others' context better, criteria for success emerged.`
