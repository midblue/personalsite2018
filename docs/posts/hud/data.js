  description: `In this post, we'll take a look at the different information that can be communicated through damage indicators, the common styles of indicators we see in modern first-person shooters, and what each of those can mean in terms of a player's experience. So why should you care about this? As a game designer, you affect your players' feelings through every decision you make, whether you mean to or not. Understanding the scope of your options, along with the potential feelings that can be created through those options, is crucial to intentionally design the experience of playing your game. Good? Good. Let's begin with a few basic definitions. FPS stands for First-Person Shooter. HUD is short for Heads-Up Display,or basically the non-game elements that are shown on the player's screen at all times. That usually means things like health, a map, a player's teammates, etc. A damage indicator is what appears on the player's HUD when they take damage from an attack in a game. Now, let's get into it!`
