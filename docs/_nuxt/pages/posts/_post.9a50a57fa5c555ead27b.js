Overwatch has a nice top-down view that scales players based on vertical position, which is often used as a quick breather between dramatic attacks.","Some points are owed to OGN’s Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds casts for sheer effort: OGN has no less than eleven spectators in each game. That’s to say nothing of the undoubtedly massive team in the production room in charge of directing the narrative of such an unwieldy beast.","However, PUBG is a game where players can die in an instant.
