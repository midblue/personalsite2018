Born out of feeling dejected, and worthless, and never wanting to come back. It turns out that going to a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament isn't always as cheery as it sounds. No matter how friendly the competition, losing out 0-2 in a tournament sucks. Like, really sucks. Even if you don't consider yourself a competitive player, it's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had. When I found myself in that position, wanting to run and hide even while I was among friends, all I could think was, \"I have to do something about this.\" This is about searching for redemption for all of us down there, bravely grinding away in the loser's side of the bracket. This is a story of positivity, and of gradual growth, and of being proud of what you achieved, even if you lost 0-2.

However, it can also lead to what I've seen at most \"User Experience Designer\" jobs I've had: UX being brought in as a feel-good buzzword, interaction design getting rebranded as being \"user centered,\" and no real methodological changes. That's not to mention the enormous time and effort it can take to gain enough trust to convince leaders, especially in a foreign culture, especially as an outsider. That's where a bottom-up mentorship approach to gaining UX acceptance can also be crucial in cultures where it's not common: you can help build the foundation of local UX champions that will spark the user centered revolution from the inside."}},rGQh:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var o=function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return this.orderedPosts?t("div",{staticClass:"page-content"},[t("PostList",{attrs:{posts:this.orderedPosts}}),t("ImageGallery",{attrs:{title:"Extras!",images:this.galleryImages}})],1):this._e()};o._withStripped=!0;var n={render:o,staticRenderFns:[]};t.a=n},sMbu:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var o=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",{staticClass:"inner-nav",class:{hover:e.hover},on:{mouseout:function(t){e.hover=!1}}},[a("div",{staticClass:"overlay"}),e._l(e.sections,function(t,o){return a("div",{key:o,staticClass:"element",class:{highlight:e.hover==="h"+o},on:{mouseover:function(t){e.hover="h"+o}}},[a("div",{staticClass:"line"}),a("nuxt-link",{staticClass:"block",attrs:{to:"/"+t.slug}},[a("div",{staticClass:"dot"})]),a("div",{staticClass:"title"},[a("nuxt-link",{attrs:{to:"/posts/"+t.slug}},[e._v("\n        "+e._s(t.title)+"\n      ")])],1)],1)})],2)};o._withStripped=!0;var n={render:o,staticRenderFns:[]};t.a=n},udGZ:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var o=a("Envs"),n=a("k3kl"),i=a("oEaD");t.a={props:[],components:{PostList:o.a,Nav:i.a,ImageGallery:n.a},data:function(){return{}},asyncData:function(){var e=[],t=a("MtPX");t.keys().forEach(function(a){"projects"===t(a).category&&e.push(t(a))});var o=a("5Xv+"),n=a("iese");return{posts:e,postOrder:o,galleryImages:n}},head:function(){return{title:"Home",meta:[{hid:"description",name:"description",content:"UX engineer, friendly ghost."}]}},computed:{userLanguage:function(){return this.$store.state.userLanguage},orderedPosts:function(){var e=this;return this.postOrder.map(function(t){var a=e.posts.find(function(e){return e.slug===t});if(a)return-1!==e.userLanguage.toLowerCase().indexOf("ja")&&!0===a.s?null:a}).filter(function(e){return e})}},watch:{},mounted:function(){this.$store.commit("set",{page:"home",pageCategory:"projects"})},methods:{}}},xL4x:function(e,t){e.exports={title:"A UX Analysis of First-Person Shooter Damage Indicators",slug:"hud",category:"writing",img:"/posts/hud/header.png",date:"Spring 2018",description:"In this post, we'll take a look at the different information that can be communicated through damage indicators, the common styles of indicators we see in modern first-person shooters, and what each of those can mean in terms of a player's experience. So why should you care about this? As a game designer, you affect your players' feelings through every decision you make, whether you mean to or not. Understanding the scope of your options, along with the potential feelings that can be created through those options, is crucial to intentionally design the experience of playing your game. Good? Good. Let's begin with a few basic definitions. FPS stands for First-Person Shooter. HUD is short for Heads-Up Display,or basically the non-game elements that are shown on the player's screen at all times. That usually means things like health, a map, a player's teammates, etc. A damage indicator is what appears on the player's HUD when they take damage from an attack in a game.

I’m usually hooked on at least two or three games at once, and it tends to be my background for work, for falling asleep, and for writing. At a certain point, I decided it was time to sit down and analyze: exactly what’s going on here to make me so engaged? How can I make that same level of engagement happen for spectators of the games that I work on? Well, after a long period of considering esports as not a spectator, but as a designer, I’m here to present the fruits of my labor. In this article, I’m going to pose some criteria for what makes an esport an exciting and engaging experience, while giving notes on designing your own game as an esport."}}});
