Along with the unstoppable Matt Tomasulo, I helped push the envelope of creative potential for underused spaces within my hometown of Raleigh, NC. Our goal was to get people thinking about how abandoned spaces could be put to use by staging a guerrilla urbanist intervention around an unused lot downtown. We started out thinking broad, concocting a plan to design interventions for various underutilized spaces around Raleigh. We would create physical and digital campaigns to build buzz, with the end goal of attracting funding to make our concepts into reality. Our first target had been chosen, and not having any clue what kind of response we would get from the public or the owners of the property, we got to work. Some panoramic photos, a few hours in Photoshop, and a few trips to a sign store later, we were ready to put the plan in motion."}},237:function(e,t){e.exports={title:"The 7 Crucial Qualities of a Great Spectator Esport",slug:"esports7",category:"writing",img:"/posts/esports7/header.png",date:"Spring 2018",description:"Even for someone who works at a game company, I watch a lot of esports. I’m usually hooked on at least two or three games at once, and it tends to be my background for work, for falling asleep, and for writing. At a certain point, I decided it was time to sit down and analyze: exactly what’s going on here to make me so engaged? How can I make that same level of engagement happen for spectators of the games that I work on? Well, after a long period of considering esports as not a spectator, but as a designer, I’m here to present the fruits of my labor. In this article, I’m going to pose some criteria for what makes an esport an exciting and engaging experience, while giving notes on designing your own game as an esport."}},238:function(e,t){e.exports={title:"A Game UX Primer for Web/App UX Designers",slug:"gameux",category:"writing",img:"/posts/gameux/header.png",description:"Game UX is on the rise! In the past ten years, starting as side events to major game industry events such as GDC, we've seen conferences like the Game UX Summit and the Games User Research Conference spring up to advance the discipline of game UX. The number of game companies hiring in UX roles is also climbing sharply. But what the heck is game UX? Don't we just apply the same principles we use in web and app contexts to a game and call it a day? The answer is: no, not always. I'm writing this post to discuss a few key ways in which it's very different. That's is not to say that traditional UX approaches have no place in game UX. In fact, it's crucial to start from a base of existing knowledge when experimenting with new tools and forms of thinking. Rather, my goal with this post is to highlight a few of the game-UX-specific methods that I see repeatedly in case studies as well as in my own experience, and to analyze just how they are different from website and app UX design standards.

So why should you care about this? As a game designer, you affect your players' feelings through every decision you make, whether you mean to or not. Understanding the scope of your options, along with the potential feelings that can be created through those options, is crucial to intentionally design the experience of playing your game. Good? Good. Let's begin with a few basic definitions. FPS stands for First-Person Shooter. HUD is short for Heads-Up Display,or basically the non-game elements that are shown on the player's screen at all times. That usually means things like health, a map, a player's teammates, etc. A damage indicator is what appears on the player's HUD when they take damage from an attack in a game.

However, it can also lead to what I've seen at most \"User Experience Designer\" jobs I've had: UX being brought in as a feel-good buzzword, interaction design getting rebranded as being \"user centered,\" and no real methodological changes. That's not to mention the enormous time and effort it can take to gain enough trust to convince leaders, especially in a foreign culture, especially as an outsider. That's where a bottom-up mentorship approach to gaining UX acceptance can also be crucial in cultures where it's not common: you can help build the foundation of local UX champions that will spark the user centered revolution from the inside."}},243:function(e,t){e.exports={title:"Using Social Media to Live-Detect System Issues",slug:"monitor",category:"projects",s:!0,img:"/posts/monitor/header.jpg",date:"Summer 2017",description:"This is a quick post about a fun project I did while working in Tokyo.

The idea was to make a tool that would track negative tweet activity about the company's games so that we can detect server or service issues before they're reflected in other metrics. As the lead engineer, I got to flex my full-stack muscles on this project. I was also in charge of designing the tool's visuals and interactions. The client for this Twitter Monitor app uses Vue to generate everything, even as far down as the internals of the SVG graphs! That's right, I got to learn how to hand-code SVGs for this one. The frontend is responsive, adapting to phones, desktop, and tv screens – the CS team keeps a giant monitor projecting this app 24/7.

Even if you don't consider yourself a competitive player, it's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had.

Next, I did some foundational research into the different kinds of tools available to language learners.
