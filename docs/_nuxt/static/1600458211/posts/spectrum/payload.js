She’s an urbanist, and not particularly involved in the digital design field, so she asked the closest designer who happened to be on hand (me), “what kind of designers should I be looking for?” I thought for a moment and realized that I had several possible answers, none of which quite summed up the full scope of roles that are present in our field today and what each designer’s assumed title really says about their abilities. That started me thinking about what exactly the spectrum of digital design roles really looks like these days. I started sketching out my ideas.

The point is that every designer has varying degrees of ability in different skills based on their experience, whether that’s vector design, digital prototyping, user research, coding, motion graphics, or anything across the entire creative spectrum. Therefore, the title they call themselves on paper can’t possibly hope to define their philosophy and scope of experience."]},{h2:"“All right, that’s great, but I just want to know what type of designer to hire!”"},{p:["I hear you loud and clear. So, with the knowledge that we will never truly represent the full scope of any one human with a single deterministic title, let’s try to define some singular, deterministic titles.","All sarcasm aside, here begins an honest look (in my own, personal opinion) at what kind of design roles are generally being seen out there in the wild."]},{h2:"1.

But if you want to laser focus in on hiring a person to do a specific thing for you, you might as well find someone who describes themselves as a specialist. You can usually count on someone who goes by one of these titles to do that specific task at a very high level of quality.","Also, yes, I put front-end developers on a chart about designers. There’s enough blurring of the line between designer and developer these days that I feel like it’s important to have a baseline of where the full-time devs stand on the spectrum.","One note on reading these charts: the upper line of a role represents the common breadth of that role, while the shade beneath represents varying depths of ability along the spectrum."]},{h2:"2.

These tend to serve more as catch-all terms, and it’s not always easy to be sure what a designer going by this title is skilled in. This is where portfolios and interviews can back up a vague title with solid examples of what exactly this designer brings to the table and how strong their skills are on visuals, implementation, and ideation."]},{h2:"3.

Often people in this category got there by necessity — maybe they worked at startups that demanded they perform roles outside their expertise, or they had personal projects where they had to cover all the bases themselves.","Some designers are quick to naysay the possibility of one person being a master in several fields simultaneously. I tend to think that those with exceptional experience or talent can tackle the challenge, especially because they tend to understand the full scope of the roles around them better than other designers. It’s a matter of understanding that this designer brings breadth over specificity to the table, and helping them succeed accordingly."]},{line:true},{p:["So, if we put all three of those together, what does it look like?"]},{img:[{src:"\u002Fposts\u002Fspectrum\u002F5.png"}]},{p:["Kind of a mess.
