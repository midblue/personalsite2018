Each of these is inextricably linked to its geographical position, and has relationships and ties to other spaces, districts, and cities around it.

Urbanism is the study of places and the people who live in them, so of course it would have a 'sense of place'. The thing is, though, that much of the current discourse — essays, interviews, event reports — tends to exist in a bubble; just the one report about the one city, or the event series only in the one building, and so on and so forth. What about all the other urbanism-related topics in that city? In that country? In that continent?
