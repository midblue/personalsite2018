The biggest variance in user testing a game versus an app or website comes in the size and length of tests. App and website usage is usually goal-based – once the goal is accomplished, the session usually ends. Oppositely, gameplay can last for hours at a time and is often much more exploratory and collaborative. To answer this, test environments expand and test durations lengthen dramatically.","For example, In \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002F2007\u002F08\u002Fff-halo-2\u002F?currentPage=all\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ean article\u003C\u002Fa\u003E about the user testing of Halo 3, it was noted that the Microsoft UX team \"...analyzed more than 3,000 hours of Halo 3.\" This is a gargantuan number compared to most UX tests, but it makes sense when the scope of varied experiences and flows embedded in a major game is taken into consideration. Each individual test session likely lasted a period of several hours, something that's nearly unheard of in the app\u002Fwebsite space. We'll get into exactly how analysis can be done on such a huge dataset a bit later.","As for the scope of a single test, there's a definite trend toward higher concurrent player numbers. For example, Riot Games \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnexus.leagueoflegends.com\u002Fen-us\u002F2018\u002F01\u002Fthe-human-side-of-emotes\u002F\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Erecently announced\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a new testing lab where over 60 players can participate in a test at once!

Where an app might use time to task completion or frequency of mistakes made by users to judge a design's merits, game UX researchers might use different metrics – such as the tone of communication with other players, players' progress at X minute intervals, or even players' heart rates and eye movements – to gain insight into how successful a level or interaction is.","On that note..."]},{h2:"Data Gathering & Analysis"},{p:["Considering the massive amount of data that user testing for games can create, how are these game UX teams possibly analyzing that mountain of information in a useful way?","The answer lies in custom analytics and built-in data capturing and visualization tools.","Take a game like Destiny 2, where overworld levels are fairly freeform, and allow players to roam and interact without major restriction. How would useful information be gleaned out of, say, a 3-hour playtest with 15 players?"]},{img:[{src:"\u002Fposts\u002Fgameux\u002F3.jpg",alt:"Bungie's map-overlaid playtest feedback system.",link:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=izZcrG4WqGI"}]},{p:["Bungie's team took several approaches to data gathering here, but the one I want to highlight here is this: they gave players a 3-button panel with three feelings: 'awesome', 'lost', and 'frustrated'. Testers were instructed to press the accompanying button when they felt that way in the test.","Bungie's dev team had actually built this button system into the game, such that when a button was pressed, the player's location on the map was recorded as well. Using this data, the test team could make simple heatmaps of player emotions (as seen in the image above), which could be very easily shown and explained to the level design team, who could then rapidly iterate on problem areas in the map."]},{line:b},{p:["These kinds of built-in analytics tools allow UX research teams to parse the information they want, in the format they want. Thus, it follows that UX and development teams are linked on a much deeper level than is often found in web and app UX. If the UX team doesn't seek help from their devs in gathering key data, they will end up spending more time manually parsing raw data and less time understanding it.","Just for fun, here's another example of built-in analytics aiding in level design.","When Microsoft's UX team was doing user testing on Halo 3's Jungle level, they got their development team to build in a new system just for data allocation. Each tester's location would be marked on a map by a colored dot at five minute intervals – red for five minutes, pink for ten minutes, and so on. When all playtesters' locations were overlaid onto the same map, it was rapidly apparent where exactly in levels players were getting lost."]},{img:[{src:"\u002Fposts\u002Fgameux\u002F4.jpg",alt:"Each playtest outputs one dot of each color at the player's location every five minutes.

However, games necessarily involve challenging the player to think, learn, and grow in a way that most web or app projects try to avoid.","As The Witness' director Jonathon Blow puts it, game designers need to \"respect the player as an intelligent person who can figure things out, and who wants to discover things or come to understand more things than they knew at the start of the game.\"","Designing for intentional challenge isn't something UX designers are often used to, but designing for the satisfaction of accomplishing a task is. That means that your ability as a UX designer to optimize fun and satisfaction in difficult systems combined with a game designer's eye for mechanics and world-building will come together to make a game that's both satisfying AND challenging to play."]},{line:b},{p:["There are, of course, many other ways that UX adapts for a game environment – such as the scale of prototypes (think Steam's Early Access program) and designing for multiple different user perspectives on the same scene – but that's for another article.
