I’m usually hooked on at least two or three games at once, and it tends to be my background for work, for falling asleep, and for writing. At a certain point, I decided it was time to sit down and analyze: exactly what’s going on here to make me so engaged? How can I make that same level of engagement happen for spectators of the games that I work on? Well, after a long period of considering esports as not a spectator, but as a designer, I’m here to present the fruits of my labor. In this article, I’m going to pose some criteria for what makes an esport an exciting and engaging experience, while giving notes on designing your own game as an esport."},{title:"A Game UX Primer for Web\u002FApp UX Designers",slug:d,category:a,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Fgameux\u002Fheader.png",description:"Game UX is on the rise! In the past ten years, starting as side events to major game industry events such as GDC, we've seen conferences like the Game UX Summit and the Games User Research Conference spring up to advance the discipline of game UX. The number of game companies hiring in UX roles is also climbing sharply. But what the heck is game UX? Don't we just apply the same principles we use in web and app contexts to a game and call it a day? The answer is: no, not always. I'm writing this post to discuss a few key ways in which it's very different. That's is not to say that traditional UX approaches have no place in game UX. In fact, it's crucial to start from a base of existing knowledge when experimenting with new tools and forms of thinking. Rather, my goal with this post is to highlight a few of the game-UX-specific methods that I see repeatedly in case studies as well as in my own experience, and to analyze just how they are different from website and app UX design standards.

I spent two solid days one fine Tokyo autumn with the Sea You Soon team at the 2017 Global Goals Jam, brainstorming and prototyping ways to get city-oriented Tokyoites and their children to engage with the natural water resources around them. \"Global Goals Jam? What the heck is that!?\" I hear you ask. Well, the Global Goals Jam (GGJ) is an annual event run simultaneously in 20? cities around the world, in which participants use UX design principles to address one of 23? sustainability goals put together by the United Nations Development Program.

So why should you care about this? As a game designer, you affect your players' feelings through every decision you make, whether you mean to or not. Understanding the scope of your options, along with the potential feelings that can be created through those options, is crucial to intentionally design the experience of playing your game. Good? Good. Let's begin with a few basic definitions. FPS stands for First-Person Shooter. HUD is short for Heads-Up Display,or basically the non-game elements that are shown on the player's screen at all times. That usually means things like health, a map, a player's teammates, etc. A damage indicator is what appears on the player's HUD when they take damage from an attack in a game. Now, let's get into it!"},{title:"How to be a Cross-Cultural UX Mentor",slug:g,category:a,s:h,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Fmentor\u002Fheader.jpg",date:e,description:"I've seen a lot of discussion around top-down UX: earning a seat at the table and convincing higher-ups that UX is worth pursuing companywide. This is very, very important. However, it can also lead to what I've seen at most \"User Experience Designer\" jobs I've had: UX being brought in as a feel-good buzzword, interaction design getting rebranded as being \"user centered,\" and no real methodological changes. That's not to mention the enormous time and effort it can take to gain enough trust to convince leaders, especially in a foreign culture, especially as an outsider. That's where a bottom-up mentorship approach to gaining UX acceptance can also be crucial in cultures where it's not common: you can help build the foundation of local UX champions that will spark the user centered revolution from the inside."},{title:"The Spectrum of Digital Design Roles",slug:i,category:a,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Fspectrum\u002Fheader.png",date:b,description:"Recently, a colleague of mine named Mariko Sugita needed to hire a designer for a website she was creating. She’s an urbanist, and not particularly involved in the digital design field, so she asked the closest designer who happened to be on hand (me), “what kind of designers should I be looking for?” I thought for a moment and realized that I had several possible answers, none of which quite summed up the full scope of roles that are present in our field today and what each designer’s assumed title really says about their abilities. That started me thinking about what exactly the spectrum of digital design roles really looks like these days. I started sketching out my ideas. When Mariko saw my notes for this article, she said, “yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to know beforehand!” I hope that this overview can be just as useful for you, too.
