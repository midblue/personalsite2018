Along with the unstoppable Matt Tomasulo, I helped push the envelope of creative potential for underused spaces within my hometown of Raleigh, NC. Our goal was to get people thinking about how abandoned spaces could be put to use by staging a guerrilla urbanist intervention around an unused lot downtown. We started out thinking broad, concocting a plan to design interventions for various underutilized spaces around Raleigh. We would create physical and digital campaigns to build buzz, with the end goal of attracting funding to make our concepts into reality. Our first target had been chosen, and not having any clue what kind of response we would get from the public or the owners of the property, we got to work. Some panoramic photos, a few hours in Photoshop, and a few trips to a sign store later, we were ready to put the plan in motion."},{title:"Bringing UX Research to an Unfamiliar Audience",slug:d,category:a,s:e,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Finternalapp\u002Fheader.jpg",date:f,description:"Research is a broad topic. When I joined a Tokyo game company's research division in 2017, my teammates only did technical research — patents, hardware tests, and peer reviewed publications. Then there was me: the only person at the entire 2000+ employee company who had \"UX\" in their job title. This is the story of a project I led which helped bring UX research to the table. One of my main goals at the company was to introduce user-centered thinking and creation methods to the employees, many of whom had never heard of UX before. It was going to be an uphill struggle."},{title:"Using Social Media to Live-Detect System Issues",slug:g,category:a,s:e,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Fmonitor\u002Fheader.jpg",date:"Summer 2017",description:"This is a quick post about a fun project I did while working in Tokyo. It's got a lot of moving parts meshing together to make a nice, self-contained utility. So what is it? The idea was to make a tool that would track negative tweet activity about the company's games so that we can detect server or service issues before they're reflected in other metrics. As the lead engineer, I got to flex my full-stack muscles on this project. I was also in charge of designing the tool's visuals and interactions. The client for this Twitter Monitor app uses Vue to generate everything, even as far down as the internals of the SVG graphs! That's right, I got to learn how to hand-code SVGs for this one. The frontend is responsive, adapting to phones, desktop, and tv screens – the CS team keeps a giant monitor projecting this app 24\u002F7. The graphs can be dragged back in time, and the live previews run in an infinite ticker."},{title:"Positivity: Using Bracket Data to Encourage Low-Placing Players",slug:h,category:a,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Fpositivity\u002Fheader.jpg",date:"Winter 2018",description:"This is a project that was born out of frustration and self-disgust. Born out of feeling dejected, and worthless, and never wanting to come back. It turns out that going to a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament isn't always as cheery as it sounds. No matter how friendly the competition, losing out 0-2 in a tournament sucks. Like, really sucks. Even if you don't consider yourself a competitive player, it's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had. When I found myself in that position, wanting to run and hide even while I was among friends, all I could think was, \"I have to do something about this.\" This is about searching for redemption for all of us down there, bravely grinding away in the loser's side of the bracket. This is a story of positivity, and of gradual growth, and of being proud of what you achieved, even if you lost 0-2. This is one for the underdogs."},{title:"SafeSpace, a Discord Bot to Keep Hate Speech Out of Your Server (and Everyone Else's, Too!)",slug:i,category:a,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Fsafespace\u002Fheader.png",date:"Summer 2019",description:"\"Go back to where you came from\" is dominating headlines as I write this post; it seems like unabashed vitriol and prejudice is in fashion in the late '10s. I get sad reading the news lately, and when I get sad about a situation, I want to make things to change it. So, I built a bot that tracks hate speech and hate speech users across the whole Discord platform. How? Why?

Urbanism is the study of places and the people who live in them, so of course it would have a 'sense of place'. The thing is, though, that much of the current discourse — essays, interviews, event reports — tends to exist in a bubble; just the one report about the one city, or the event series only in the one building, and so on and so forth. What about all the other urbanism-related topics in that city? In that country? In that continent? I was lucky enough to lead the design (ux, interaction, and visual) and full-stack development on a new responsive platform that puts urban narratives and practices in context with one another, globally."},{title:"A Discord Timezone Bot for Multinational Groups",slug:k,category:a,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Ftimezonebot\u002Fheader.png",date:"Spring 2018",description:"My closest friends from my school days and I keep in touch regularly through Discord, a Slack-esque chat tool focused around gaming. As we've gotten older, we've begun to spread out all over the world, which that means that many of us live in vastly different time zones. Very often we resort to googling what time it is in Japan, or in Oregon, or in North Carolina. I decided that there had to be a simple way to ease our timezone woes that wouldn't require trips to the browser, or even knowing where a person was currently located. Thus, with the goal of helping our group communicate and understand each others' context better, criteria for success emerged."},{title:"Verbose: Designing a Language-Learning Tool for Self-Teachers",slug:l,category:a,img:"\u002Fposts\u002Fverbose\u002Fheader.jpg",date:c,description:"Inspired by challenges I faced while teaching myself Japanese, I designed a concept tablet app to help self-teachers learn languages. Over the span of eight weeks, I conducted interviews, researched existing tools, mapped the service, iterated on screens, and shot and animated a demo video. My first step was to define the needs of my users, so I reached out to language learners as well as language teachers for some interviews. It became clear that for self-teachers, most learning took place in the gaps between their day-to-day responsibilities, and that their learning styles and levels of dedication varied dramatically. Next, I did some foundational research into the different kinds of tools available to language learners. Based on my interview results and other information I dug up through my research, I created a map to figure out how the tool I was designing would fit within the ecosystem."}],postOrder:[j,i,h,k,d,l,g,b],galleryImages:["\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F1.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F12.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F6.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F10.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F8.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F7.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F3.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F9.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F16.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F14.jpg","\u002Fimages\u002Fgallery\u002F15.jpg"]}],fetch:[],mutations:[]}}("projects","beach","2013","internalapp",true,"Fall 2017","monitor","positivity","safespace","tcu","timezonebot","verbose")));
