Along with the unstoppable Matt Tomasulo, I helped push the envelope of creative potential for underused spaces within my hometown of Raleigh, NC. Our goal was to get people thinking about how abandoned spaces could be put to use by staging a guerrilla urbanist intervention around an unused lot downtown. We started out thinking broad, concocting a plan to design interventions for various underutilized spaces around Raleigh. We would create physical and digital campaigns to build buzz, with the end goal of attracting funding to make our concepts into reality. Our first target had been chosen, and not having any clue what kind of response we would get from the public or the owners of the property, we got to work. Some panoramic photos, a few hours in Photoshop, and a few trips to a sign store later, we were ready to put the plan in motion."}},239:function(e,t){e.exports={title:"The 7 Crucial Qualities of a Great Spectator Esport",slug:"esports7",category:"writing",img:"/posts/esports7/header.png",date:"Spring 2018",description:"Even for someone who works at a game company, I watch a lot of esports. I’m usually hooked on at least two or three games at once, and it tends to be my background for work, for falling asleep, and for writing. At a certain point, I decided it was time to sit down and analyze: exactly what’s going on here to make me so engaged? How can I make that same level of engagement happen for spectators of the games that I work on? Well, after a long period of considering esports as not a spectator, but as a designer, I’m here to present the fruits of my labor. In this article, I’m going to pose some criteria for what makes an esport an exciting and engaging experience, while giving notes on designing your own game as an esport."}},240:function(e,t){e.exports={title:"A Game UX Primer for Web/App UX Designers",slug:"gameux",category:"writing",img:"/posts/gameux/header.png",description:"Game UX is on the rise! In the past ten years, starting as side events to major game industry events such as GDC, we've seen conferences like the Game UX Summit and the Games User Research Conference spring up to advance the discipline of game UX. The number of game companies hiring in UX roles is also climbing sharply. But what the heck is game UX? Don't we just apply the same principles we use in web and app contexts to a game and call it a day? The answer is: no, not always. I'm writing this post to discuss a few key ways in which it's very different. That's is not to say that traditional UX approaches have no place in game UX. In fact, it's crucial to start from a base of existing knowledge when experimenting with new tools and forms of thinking. Rather, my goal with this post is to highlight a few of the game-UX-specific methods that I see repeatedly in case studies as well as in my own experience, and to analyze just how they are different from website and app UX design standards.

So why should you care about this? As a game designer, you affect your players' feelings through every decision you make, whether you mean to or not. Understanding the scope of your options, along with the potential feelings that can be created through those options, is crucial to intentionally design the experience of playing your game. Good? Good. Let's begin with a few basic definitions. FPS stands for First-Person Shooter. HUD is short for Heads-Up Display,or basically the non-game elements that are shown on the player's screen at all times. That usually means things like health, a map, a player's teammates, etc. A damage indicator is what appears on the player's HUD when they take damage from an attack in a game.

This is very, very important. However, it can also lead to what I've seen at most \"User Experience Designer\" jobs I've had: UX being brought in as a feel-good buzzword, interaction design getting rebranded as being \"user centered,\" and no real methodological changes. That's not to mention the enormous time and effort it can take to gain enough trust to convince leaders, especially in a foreign culture, especially as an outsider. That's where a bottom-up mentorship approach to gaining UX acceptance can also be crucial in cultures where it's not common: you can help build the foundation of local UX champions that will spark the user centered revolution from the inside."}},245:function(e,t){e.exports={title:"Using Social Media to Live-Detect System Issues",slug:"monitor",category:"projects",s:!0,img:"/posts/monitor/header.jpg",date:"Summer 2017",description:"This is a quick post about a fun project I did while working in Tokyo.

The idea was to make a tool that would track negative tweet activity about the company's games so that we can detect server or service issues before they're reflected in other metrics. As the lead engineer, I got to flex my full-stack muscles on this project. I was also in charge of designing the tool's visuals and interactions. The client for this Twitter Monitor app uses Vue to generate everything, even as far down as the internals of the SVG graphs! That's right, I got to learn how to hand-code SVGs for this one. The frontend is responsive, adapting to phones, desktop, and tv screens – the CS team keeps a giant monitor projecting this app 24/7.

Even if you don't consider yourself a competitive player, it's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had.

Upset Potential In-Game"},{p:["There is a delicate line between too stagnant, and variant to the point where players cry foul. For example, in the first stage of their inaugural season in the Overwatch league, the Shanghai Dragons failed to take even a single match, ending the stage 0–12. They didn’t necessarily have terrible players, and they did win individual maps, but the nature of the format meant that each match stretched on for long enough that no matter how much of an accomplishment a map win might seem, it simply wasn’t feasible for a lesser team to clutch out a victory in the long run.","On the other hand, if we look at traditional sports, the variance is comparatively high — rarely does the same team win the Superbowl twice in a row. Traditional sports also gain the time-honored excuse of blaming an upset on the referee, a luxury that esports does not have. Upsets come either from pure player skill or from game-embedded RNG (random number generation)."]},{h3:"For your new esport:"},{p:["It's up to you to intentionally design the balance between stability of top players and exciting upsets.

Casters will try to build up a lull to be dramatic, a chant will fall down to a few awkward stragglers, or a shot across the crowd will look like the flimsy bleachers at a middle school baseball game. Games like Starcraft 2 have found a good balance, with intentional periods of calm spectating before a rapid-fire crescendo.

Great Spectating"},{p:["In some games, you can see that the game developers worked directly with professional spectators to enable them to be great at their job.

Overwatch has a nice top-down view that scales players based on vertical position, which is often used as a quick breather between dramatic attacks.","Some points are owed to OGN’s Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds casts for sheer effort: OGN has no less than eleven spectators in each game. That’s to say nothing of the undoubtedly massive team in the production room in charge of directing the narrative of such an unwieldy beast.","However, PUBG is a game where players can die in an instant. That means that no matter how good a spectator may be, by the time the audience sees a scene it’s often already over, or over by the time the spectator has finished parsing who is shooting at what.

Then, as the days progress, the tension naturally builds, and players drop out more and more such that the excitement naturally peaks on a final day with the few remaining players having already drawn a storyline of players beaten and challenges faced, giving fans much to get excited about and theorycraft over.

In fact, it's crucial to start from a base of existing knowledge when experimenting with new tools and forms of thinking.","Rather, my goal with this post is to highlight a few of the game-UX-specific methods that I see repeatedly in case studies as well as in my own experience, and to analyze just how they are different from website and app UX design standards.","Let's get started!"]},{h2:"User Testing"},{p:["First off, let's think about user testing. The biggest variance in user testing a game versus an app or website comes in the size and length of tests. App and website usage is usually goal-based – once the goal is accomplished, the session usually ends. Oppositely, gameplay can last for hours at a time and is often much more exploratory and collaborative. To answer this, test environments expand and test durations lengthen dramatically.",'For example, In <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/08/ff-halo-2/?currentPage=all" target="_blank">an article</a> about the user testing of Halo 3, it was noted that the Microsoft UX team "...analyzed more than 3,000 hours of Halo 3." This is a gargantuan number compared to most UX tests, but it makes sense when the scope of varied experiences and flows embedded in a major game is taken into consideration. Each individual test session likely lasted a period of several hours, something that\'s nearly unheard of in the app/website space. We\'ll get into exactly how analysis can be done on such a huge dataset a bit later.','As for the scope of a single test, there\'s a definite trend toward higher concurrent player numbers. For example, Riot Games <a href="https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/01/the-human-side-of-emotes/" target="_blank">recently announced</a> a new testing lab where over 60 players can participate in a test at once!

Where an app might use time to task completion or frequency of mistakes made by users to judge a design's merits, game UX researchers might use different metrics – such as the tone of communication with other players, players' progress at X minute intervals, or even players' heart rates and eye movements – to gain insight into how successful a level or interaction is.","On that note..."]},{h2:"Data Gathering & Analysis"},{p:["Considering the massive amount of data that user testing for games can create, how are these game UX teams possibly analyzing that mountain of information in a useful way?","The answer lies in custom analytics and built-in data capturing and visualization tools.","Take a game like Destiny 2, where overworld levels are fairly freeform, and allow players to roam and interact without major restriction.
