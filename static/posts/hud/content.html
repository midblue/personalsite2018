DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS
Up representing forward, down representing backwards.

because we're here trying to represent 3d space on a 2d plane. 

but is that the only way? some seem to be attempting to represent it on a 3d one, showing forward and backward on a z-plane inside of the HUD, such as Destiny 2. This has its own issues, as it loses the impact of instinctively being registered as  "up" or "down," and thus requires attention to understand exactly which direction the indicator is trying to show before the player can begin to focus on engaging or protecting themselves from the attacker.

Some, on the other hand, choose to represent direction not visually, but audibly.
Games such as Player Unknown's Battlegrounds use both the sound of the attack and the sound that the player character makes as it impacts to communicate damage. Specifically the sound of the shot fired communicates direction, making the ability to parse this audio information a must for any looking to succeed.

POWER INDICATORS

There are a few ways of showing intensity of attack.
One is direct size of the indicator. Overwatch shows a larger indicator for a larger hit. 
League of legends, as with many MOBAs, takes cues from fighting games. When a player takes a hit, the damage taken is shown as life lost, and the player can watch it drain before their eyes. It often stacks with consecutive attacks, and shows a cumulative total of the effect of multiple attacks that happened at once. This approach gives a visceral cue towards the idea that size equals power, and thus allows the player to directly FEEL the attack based on its size.

Games like Dark Souls and Dead Cells use this idea extremely effectively, because they allow players to take 'revenge' while they're in this state of being shown their health lost. The damage indicator becomes a game mechanic, and any damage the player deals while being shown their lost health can be used to recoup their losses and regain health.

REMAINING LIFE INDICATORS

Some games, such as left 4 dead? and call of duty, show progressive hits as changes in the color pallette onscreen; the player's vision moves from full-color to grayscale as they assume more damage.



EXPERIENCE的に:
Often in these cases the game is more interested in conveying a feeling, especially the feeling that the player is close to death, than in showing the player what direction they should be facing. This is appropriate especially in simgle-player games, when drama is paramount and the likelihood of being outsmarted by the AI is low.



It's also important not to obscure the rest of the key HUD elements, especially considering that damage indicators will only show up for a very small amount of time that a player is interacting with the game.


So the question becomes, how can a game just barely get the player's attention enough to communicate the damage they've taken without distracting them from the fight they're in?





where does melee (and its ilk) fit?







WHAT DID WE COVER?

We covered the different information that HUD damage indicators can show, and what each of them mean in terms of information to the player.
