  "description": "This is the story of a project that was born out of my own frustration and self-disgust. A story of feeling dejected, and worthless, and never wanting to come back. It turns out that going to a Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament might not always be as cheery as it sounds; no matter how friendly the competition, losing out 0-2 in tournament sucks. Like, /really/ sucks. It's the kind of thing that hits you in a strange spot of pride that you didn't know you had, and when I found myself in that spot, wanting to run and hide while I was among friends, all I could think was, \"I have to fix this.\" This is a story about searching for redemption, for all of us down there, bravely grinding away in the lower half of the bracket. This is a story of positivity, and of gradual growth, and of being proud of what you achieved, even if you lost 0-2. This is one for the underdogs."
