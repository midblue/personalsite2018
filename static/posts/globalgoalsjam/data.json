  "description": "Let's go fishing! I spent two solid days one fine Tokyo autumn with the Sea You Soon team at the 2017 Global Goals Jam, brainstorming and prototyping ways to get city-oriented Tokyoites and their children to engage with the natural water resources around them. \"Global Goals Jam? What the heck is that!?\" I hear you ask. Well, the Global Goals Jam (GGJ) is an annual event run simultaneously in 20? cities around the world, in which participants use UX design principles to address one of 23? sustainability goals put together by the United Nations Development Program. I was lucky enough to be selected as a facilitator by a colleague of mine, urbanist Mariko Sugita."
